	<h4>Assignment #4: Ray Tracer</h4>

	<p>
		The ray tracer is an algorithm for generating 2D images of 
		3D scenes. The basic premise is this: cast a ray from the eye 
		through the screen into the 3D scene, and see what it hits: 
		what it reflects, and what color are the things it hits, and 
		if what it hits is under a shadow, return the color, and draw 
		that color onto the display device.
	</p>
	<p>	
		The way that reflections are done is this: When a ray hits a surface,
		trace another viewing ray from the point of intersection, in the
		direction of the reflected beam. This will be a recursive process
		that can end in one of a few ways: after a certain number of reflections,
		after the ray has been traced for a certain length, or after the amount
		of contribution of the reflection to the color of the object is below
		a certain amount. We chose to limit based on the number of reflections
		for simple implementation and controlled computation time. The default
		number of reflections is 1.
	</p>
	<p>
		We chose the .obj file to be our format of triangle models due to its simplicity. 
		Each .obj file is defined by a list of vertices (ex. v 0 0 0), and a list of faces,
		with the index of the vertex as its data (ex. f 1 2 3). Models are imported and parsed
		a parser into a model file in memory, and then rendered using the ray tracer. Spherical
		and ellipsoids are created with command line arguments instead of passed in through a
		file. They can then be transformed by the scaling, rotating, and translation functions.

		Our ray tracer takes in the following params: <br>

		Note: we defined our -z axis to be behind the viewer, +z 
		to be in front. The screen is located with x,y spanning -1 to 1, 
		with a z-axis at a constant z=-1. The eye is located behind that, 
		at [0,0,-2].
	</p>
	<p>
		We did not use the eigen library for most of our renderings 
		(with the exception of the ellipsoid, which we did at the end).
		Instead we wrote our own primitives from scratch. 
		Because of this, most of our computations were rather sluggishly
		slow. All of the renderings were done on a single core of 3.2Ghz.
